    <h2><p>Chicken, tomatoes, fresh spinach and mozzarella combine to create this dish. 
        The recipe creator recommends using your favorite shell pasta. "I tripled the recipe and had no leftovers. 
        This never happens in my house</p>
    </h2>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cubed</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped, or to taste</li>
        <li>Â½ cup red cooking wine</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can Italian-style diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>8 ounces small seashell pasta</li>
        <li>5 ounces fresh spinach, chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet with a lid over medium heat; 
                cook and stir the chicken and garlic until the chicken is no
                 longer pink in the center, 5 to 8 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Pour wine and diced tomatoes with their juice into the skillet, 
                and bring to a boil over high heat while scraping any browned bits
                 of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in shell pasta and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, 
                until shells have cooked through, but are still firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. 
                Spread spinach over the top of pasta, cover, and simmer until spinach leaves are cooked, 
                about 5 minutes. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese evenly over the skillet; 
                simmer until the cheese has melted and the pasta is bubbling, about 5 minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>
