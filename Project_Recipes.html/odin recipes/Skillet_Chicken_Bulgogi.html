    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine the broth, tomato paste,
                 ground black pepper, oregano,
                 salt and garlic. Mix well and set aside.</li>

            <li>
                Dredge the chicken in the bread crumbs, coating well. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. 
                Saute the chicken in the oil for 2 minutes per side, or until lightly browned.
            </li>
                Add the reserved broth mixture and the mushrooms to the skillet and bring to a boil.
                Then cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes. Remove chicken and set aside, covering to keep it warm.
