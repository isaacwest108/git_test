    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat an oven-safe pot over medium-high heat; stir rice and 2 tablespoons oil together in the hot 
                saucepan to coat the rice with oil. Pour hot water over the rice; bring to a boil and place a cover on the pot.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake rice in preheated oven until the water is absorbed and rice is tender, 12 to 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place broccoli into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. 
                Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and season broccoli with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat remaining oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; add chicken to hot oil, season with garlic powder and onion powder.
                 Saute chicken until completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir onion into the chicken; continue cooking until onions are soft and translucent, 5 to 7 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spoon rice into the skillet; cook until lightly browned on the bottom, about 3 minutes. Stir broccoli into the rice mixture;
                 sprinkle lemon zest and lemon juice over the mixture and stir. Top with Parmesan cheese.
            </li>
        </ol>
